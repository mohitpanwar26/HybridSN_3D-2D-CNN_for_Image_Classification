# HybridSN: Exploring 3-Dâ€“2-D CNN Feature Hierarchy for Hyperspectral Image Classification

Implemented the paper :- HybridSN_Exploring_3-D2-D_CNN_Feature_Hierarchy_for_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8736016)


How to run the code :
 
1. Run the python file HybridSN_ML.py.
2. A pop up will be shown where you need to provide the required image data file. I have used Indian Pines and Salinas-A dataset.
3. Another pop up will be shown where you need to provide the required image ground truth file.
3. It will ask you for the no. of epoches provide suitable epochs, from our observation even 30 epochs give good result.
4. wait for some time it will show the final True and predicted images side by side.
5. After that it will show the plot of training accuracy vs epochs.
6. At last it will show the whole classification Report for the given dataset.
